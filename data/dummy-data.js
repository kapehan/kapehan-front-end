    excerpt:
      "Learn how different coffee growing regions around the world influence the taste and characteristics of your favorite brew.",
    content: `
      <h2>The World of Coffee Origins</h2>
      <p>Coffee beans from different regions around the world have distinct flavor profiles influenced by climate, soil, altitude, and processing methods. Understanding these differences can help you choose coffees that match your taste preferences.</p>
      
      <h3>African Coffees</h3>
      <h4>Ethiopia</h4>
      <p>Often considered the birthplace of coffee, Ethiopian beans are known for their bright acidity, floral notes, and wine-like qualities. Popular varieties include Yirgacheffe and Sidamo.</p>
      
      <h4>Kenya</h4>
      <p>Kenyan coffees are famous for their bright acidity, full body, and black currant flavors. They often have a wine-like quality with a clean finish.</p>
      
      <h3>Central and South American Coffees</h3>
      <h4>Colombia</h4>
      <p>Colombian coffee is well-balanced with medium body, bright acidity, and nutty or chocolatey notes. It's often used in blends due to its consistent quality.</p>
      
      <h4>Guatemala</h4>
      <p>Guatemalan beans typically offer full body, rich flavor, and a smoky or spicy character, especially those grown in volcanic soil.</p>
      
      <h3>Asian and Pacific Coffees</h3>
      <h4>Indonesia</h4>
      <p>Indonesian coffees, particularly from Sumatra and Java, are known for their full body, low acidity, and earthy, herbal flavors.</p>
      
      <h4>Hawaii</h4>
      <p>Kona coffee from Hawaii is smooth, rich, and has a unique flavor profile with low acidity and a clean finish.</p>
      
      <h3>Processing Methods</h3>
      <p>How coffee is processed after harvesting also affects flavor:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Washed/Wet Process:</strong> Clean, bright flavors with pronounced acidity</li>
        <li><strong>Natural/Dry Process:</strong> Fruity, sweet flavors with full body</li>
        <li><strong>Honey Process:</strong> Balanced sweetness between washed and natural</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Choosing Your Perfect Coffee</h3>
      <p>Consider these factors when selecting coffee beans:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Preferred flavor intensity (light, medium, or dark roast)</li>
        <li>Acidity preference (bright vs. low acid)</li>
        <li>Body preference (light vs. full-bodied)</li>
        <li>Flavor notes you enjoy (fruity, nutty, chocolatey, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Experimenting with different origins and processing methods is the best way to discover your personal preferences and expand your coffee palate!</p>
